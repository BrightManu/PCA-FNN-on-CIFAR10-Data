# PCA-FNN-on-CIFAR10-Data
This project demonstrates the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to reduce computational complexity while maintaining classification performance.
