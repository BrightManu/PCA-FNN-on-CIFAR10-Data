# PCA-FNN-on-CIFAR10-Data
This project demonstrates the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to reduce computational complexity while maintaining classification performance.

## Key Features
- **Dataset**: Utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA is applied to reduce the high-dimensional image data to a lower-dimensional feature space.
- **Classification**: A fully connected Feedforward Neural Network is trained on the reduced data to classify images.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the model's performance.

## Highlights
- Achieved efficient dimensionality reduction while retaining key features of the dataset.
- Optimized neural network architecture for classification on the reduced feature set.
- Included visualizations of PCA explained variance and FNN training progress.
